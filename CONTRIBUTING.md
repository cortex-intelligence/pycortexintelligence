# Guidelines

Analyze tickets’ context and history

Start small

When we say “PEP 8, and must have docs and tests”, we mean it. If a patch doesn’t have docs and tests, there had better be a good reason. Arguments like “I couldn’t find any existing tests of this feature” don’t carry much weight–while it may be true, that means you have the extra-important job of writing the very first tests for that feature, not that you get a pass from writing tests altogether.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) notation.
